#### Short description
The main aim of this project turn reading books on foreign languages 
into fun and relax but without missing the learning part. I am a big 
fan of paper books, so currently, this project is for paper books.  
So what it does do? It converts the book into the full dictionary with all 
words in the book and does it in different modes ( convert only one chapter or a 
full book, this is up to the user's preferences).  
##### Future plans
This is just the first implementation of my project,  but I have a lot of ideas 
on how to evolve it and make it more useful for e-books too.
